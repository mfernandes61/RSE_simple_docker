# RSE_simple_docker
Very simple Docker container to demonstrate Building with Dockerfile  
git clone this repository into your workshop directory (a2) and move into the   
RSE_simpe_docker directory (where you will see the Dockerfile & can examine it).  
Build the container with 'docker build .' and note the final container id and use  
'docker tag <id> <cont.name>' where <cont.name> is something human friendly.  
Execute it with 'docker run -it -v <RSE VM dir>/:/home/test/output/ <cont.name> /bin/bash'  
This will map your local VM directory to the scripts output directory (examine the results)
